                  Starting with a single fish and chips restaurant in Calgary’s
                  beltline in 1985 at just 21 years of age, Klassen has grown
                  his Joey’s Group of Companies into a true empire. It includes
                  over 60 restaurants across Canada, magazines, a printing
                  company, a wholesale food import-distribution company, a
                  biodiesel plant, an oil servicing business, land development
                  and commercial buildings and more, employing over 800 people
                  across the country. And his story is nowhere near finished.
                  Upon learning about the Web3 space from Dominic and Nigel, Joe
                  immediately knew that this technology had the potential to
                  change the world, and as with all of his business ventures, he
                  wanted to be at the forefront of it.

                  Enter the next generation, after finishing his pro football
                  career of 7 years. Michael Has been an integral part into the
                  creation and success of the Joeys’ groups newest venture
                  strEATS Kitchens. Helping in his offseason since 2014 he has
                  now joined the team full time in late 2019 wherein, he quickly
                  took over the marketing and overall brand direction. His
                  unorthodox marketing ideas/schemes have helped put strEATS on
                  the map nationally with hopes of soon being an international
                  discussion. He understands the value of being early to the NFT
                  space in hopes of being one of the first brands to adopt a
                  blockchain based loyalty club for the restaurants.
