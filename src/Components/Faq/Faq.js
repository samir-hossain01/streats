                      StrEATS is an up-and-coming restaurant franchise based out
                      of Canada. We opened our first location in 2017 and over
                      the last four years we have grown to 15 locations with
                      many more planned to open soon. Our menu consists of
                      globally inspired street food such as tacos, burritos,
                      bowls & poutines. We pride ourselves in using only the
                      freshest ingredients to deliver excellence and provide our
                      customers and community members the experience they
                      deserve! In 2021 the StrEATS brand achieved $6,000,000 in
                      revenue and a brand growth of 75% with absolutely no signs
                      of slowing down! We plan to continue to grow the StrEATS
                      brand internationally at the same blistering pace we have
                      done in the past, and we hope to expand globally within
                      the coming years.

                      From the flavours we use to the foods we create, to our
                      marketing tactics, StrEATS has always strived to be at the
                      leading edge of innovation, this is no different when it
                      comes to Web3. We at StrEATS understand the long lasting
                      impact crypto and NFTs will have on our world, and we
                      believe that we have something to offer the NFT space that
                      has never been seen before. By launching a project backed
                      by real-world assets and real-world utility, we also hope
                      to help push the space towards the public eye, and push
                      the narrative that NFT’s aren’t just pictures of monkeys
                      you see online, but something so much more than that.

                      We don’t want to set anything in stone yet, as the quality
                      of the project is our number one priority. But we
